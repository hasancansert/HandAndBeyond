## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are algorithms designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering raw input. These algorithms somewhat mimic how a human brain operates, hence the name "neural network".

### Layers in a Neural Network

- **Input Layer**: This layer receives your data, akin to presenting an image to your eyes.
- **Hidden Layers**: These are intermediate layers between input and output, processing data much like the brain does after seeing an image.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer, which delivers the result, such as your brain identifying that the image you saw was a 'cat'.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

**Code**:
```python
df = pd.read_csv(path)
features = df.drop(columns=["label", "class", "time"]).values
labels = df["class"].values
```

**What's Happening Here?**
- We're using `pandas`, a library, to read our dataset. 
- "Features" are the input data (EMG readings), while "labels" are the expected output (gesture type).

## Neural Network Model with TensorFlow

TensorFlow lets us define and train neural networks. We use its Keras API for a more straightforward interface.

**Code**:
```python
model = Sequential([
    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)),
    ...
    layers.Dense(8, activation='softmax')
])
```

**What's Happening Here?**
- We're defining a sequential neural network.
- `Dense` layers are fully interconnected.
- Activation functions, like `relu` and `softmax`, determine the neuron's output.

## Training the Neural Network

Training is where the neural network "learns" from the data.

**Code**:
```python
opt = optimizers.Nadam(lr=1e-3)
model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=512, epochs=10)
```

**What's Happening Here?**
- We're setting up an optimizer, which adjusts parameters to reduce errors.
- The loss function measures the prediction errors.
- `model.fit()` starts the training process.

## Evaluation and Prediction

After training, we evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

**Code**:
```python
evaluation = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
prediction = np.argmax(model.predict(x_test)[sample_idx])
```

**What's Happening Here?**
- We're testing the model's performance.
- We're also making a prediction on a sample EMG reading.

## Visualization

Visualizations help understand the training process.

**Code**:
```python
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
```

**What's Happening Here?**
- We're plotting the training and validation accuracy to see the model's performance over time.
